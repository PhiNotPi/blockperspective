# blockperspective

Given block coordinates, draw lines on the panorama to show the position of that block.

Important notice.... there's an issue regarding rotation (this script was originally written for when the recreation had different coords), so X/Z values aren't quite right.  I should really fix this soon.

For those who don’t have local python:
1.	Download the jupyter notebook and the required image file
2.	Go to google colab     https://colab.research.google.com/
3.	When making a new notebook, there should be an option to upload a notebook.  For example, go to File->upload notebook
4.	Once you have the notebook, there’s three buttons on the left, for table of contents, code snippets, and files.  Go to files.
5.	You might see a “connecting to runtime” message but wait for it to go away.  Then there should be an upload button that lets you upload the image file. After uploading, you might need to hit the refresh button on the files panel to see the new files.
6.	Now your notebook should work.
